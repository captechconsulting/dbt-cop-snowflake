# This defines the database, schema, and tables we are trying to ingest from.
# For every schema you want to ingest, you need to declare a source.
# In our case, our sample db only contains one schema to ingest from.
sources:
  - name: tpch_sf1

# These define the first-level tables and/or views that we will be generating.
# In addition to declaring a schema for each model, note that we can also define
# tests (dbt terminology for these would be "data tests") to run against the data.
# We are using native dbt tests, unique, relationships, and not_null, but we
# can also define custom tests to run against our data.
